def get_finite_difference_coefficients(d, order_accuracy):
        '''
        Compute the coefficients for the finite difference equation corresponding to the derivative, d, to a 
        specified order of accuracy.
        

        Parameters
        -----------------
        d: int
            The derivative in which we are approximating (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
        
        order_accuracy: int
            The order of accuracy in which the finite difference equation will approximate to. This must be a
            multiple of 2 for the symmetric difference.

        Returns

def compute_derivative(signal, t, d, order_accuracy=2):
    '''
    Compute the derivative, d,  of a signal over a constant time/sampling interval, t, using n points prior to

    Parameters
    -----------------
    signal: array_like
        an array of the signal.

    t: float
        The time interval between samples (over a vector of timestamps, it is sufficient to input t[1] -t[0]).
        Alternatively, 1/sampling frequency can also be used to denote t.

    d: int
        The derivative to take of the signal.
    
    order_accuracy: int
        The order of accuracy in which the finite difference equation will approximate to. Default = 2

    Returns
    -----------------

    signal_: ndarray
        the nth derivative of the input signal. The length of the signal is equal to that of the intput signal.
