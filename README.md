# Using the Taylor Expansion to Calculate Finite Differences in Python

More detail pertaining the math underlying the function can be found at: https://mvmtsci.com/using-the-taylor-expansion-to-calculate-finite-differences-in-python

As the title suggests, this repository contains code to compute finite differences for any derivative and order of accuracy using the Taylor Expansion. Code is contained in the .py file, while code + further details and the performance of the function can be found in the .ipynb file.

As I had mentioned in the posts, I am unaware of any other functions that operate in a similar manner (admittedly, though, I haven't tried searching for very long either). If anything similar exists or if anyone has any other feedback, I'd love to hear about it!
